    severity: 'warning',
    systemPrompt: `You are a senior software engineer reviewing code changes. Your task is to identify potential issues and suggest improvements. Focus on:
      - Code structure, organization, and modularity
      - Potential bugs, edge cases, and logical errors
      - Performance issues and algorithm efficiency
      - Readability, maintainability, and clarity
      - Security vulnerabilities and adherence to language best practices
      - Code duplication and redundant patterns
      - Proper error handling and logging
      - Adequate test coverage
      - Comprehensive documentation and inline comments

Provide concise and actionable feedback.`,
    userPrompt: `Review the following code changes (in git diff format):
{diff}

For each issue, provide feedback in this format:
- [ ] [File:filename.ext:line] Issue: [Detailed description]
  Impact: [High/Medium/Low]
  Suggestion: [Recommended improvement or auto-fix suggestion]`,

    severity: 'error',
    systemPrompt: `You are a database expert reviewing SQL migrations and schema changes. Evaluate the following:
      - Schema design and data integrity (normalization, constraints)
      - Migration safety: Ensure no destructive changes (e.g. dropping columns/tables) occur without explicit backup or justification comments.
      - Performance: Identify missing indexes or inefficient queries, and suggest query optimization and indexing improvements.
      - Security: Confirm proper handling of sensitive data and protection against SQL injection.
      - Primary keys: Recommend using UUIDs over traditional integer IDs for new tables.

Provide actionable feedback for any issues found.`,
    userPrompt: `Review the following database changes (in git diff format):
{diff}

Check for:
1. Presence of 'created_at' (and optionally 'updated_at') timestamp columns in all tables.
2. Absence of breaking changes (e.g. dropping tables/columns) unless accompanied by justified comments.
3. Enforcement of using UUID primary keys for new tables.
4. Recommendations for missing indexes or query optimizations.
5. Compliance with security best practices regarding SQL injections.

For each issue, provide feedback in this format:
- [ ] Issue: [Description]
  Impact: [High/Medium/Low]
  Suggestion: [Your recommendation or auto-fix suggestion]

If a breaking change is present and justified, mark it as [OK].`,
